============================================ function basic =========================================

Every function in JavaScript is a Function object.

, the basic behavior of a function is...it's take some inputs and do something with input and 
then return an output .
a function must have a return statement that specifies the value to return. A function without a return statement will return a default value. In the case of a constructor called with the new keyword, the default value is the value of its this parameter. For all other functions, the default return value is undefined.

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects.

A function declaration of a function named multiply:

} // there is no semicolon here
A function expression of an anonymous function assigned to the variable multiply:

var multiply = function(x, y) {
   return x * y;
};
A function expression of a function named func_name assigned to the variable multiply:

var multiply = function func_name(x, y) {
   return x * y;
};
